    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>
        I am currently a Grand Circus C# student. I have 5 weeks left before the program is over and I can start
        working. I have a goal of starting a starting a development firm immediately after, held by an enterprise that will handle
        not only that, but also three other companies that share a foundational software. The foundational software will be built
        by the development firm.

        My hometown of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis%2C_Michigan"target="_blank">Memphis</a> (MICHIGAN, NOT EGYPT OR TENNESSE) 
        is a small rural town up in the thumb area of Michian. 
        There are only about 800 people in the one stop light town. It is exactly 1 square mile in area.
